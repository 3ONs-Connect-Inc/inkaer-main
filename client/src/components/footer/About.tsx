                  At Inkaer, we believe that engineering talent should be
                  evaluated based on real skills and practical problem-solving
                  abilities, not just resumes and credentials. We've created a
                  platform where engineers can showcase their expertise through
                  hands-on projects and challenges, while employers can
                  discover talent based on demonstrated capabilities.
